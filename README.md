## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/1054329489/Bobby.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/1054329489/Bobby.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

This post is mainly about figuring out how to post and make a update plan for the whole page, about time and its content.
First of all, time.
I'm going to make 2 posts each week, maybe I'll regret for this decision, so in average, I must make an update on around Wednesday and Sunday.
As for the content, I think it should contain what I was doing, technically. And I can make some summary monthly, so it would be more like a daily for this.

I chose this way to post my blog, so I have to have a good understanding of markdown syntak. So let's start from here.
